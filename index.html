      Welcome to The Mind Catalyst!

      <p>
        Generation Z is the future, and in a world encircled by the internet and media, our personas get washed away. Our beliefs, opinions, and paradigms shift subconsciously unintentionally dissolving our individualities. We need to hold true to ourselves and not get lost in the lust of the digital age. We need to use our own brains.

        Welcome to The Mind Catalyst! We’re a team of adolescent writers driven by a diverse scheme of topics regarding modern day challenges and situations. Our topics range from politics to teenagehood, law, medicine, sports, arts, and more. We hope that this platform becomes a place where you can think critically, ask questions, and share ideas that matter to you and our future as a collective. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        Our mission is to encourage the greater society to wonder, skepticize, and educate yourself. We believe that Generation Z have the passion, the drive, and the open-mindedness to ignite a reformation of thought. And we hope you are as excited to join us in this journey as we are. Unlike mainstream political blogs, sports commentaires, or such similar platforms, this blog is unfiltered and unifying. We’re not a copy-paste blog, and we are not here to succumb to social constructs. This team is committed to encompassing a range of perspectives and encouraging respectful, and healthy argumentation. In today’s internet age, it’s common for younger voices to get lost–and be misunderstood. The Mind Catalyst is built to challenge that. Our readers are interested in diving deeper into issues that matter to us—the decisions that shape our future as we know it.

        Every Sunday going forward there will be a new blog post on our platform. Some to look forward to are; a metaphorical illustration about the lack of mental sanctuary in teenage psychological reform, an analysis of the Bystander Effect through the lens of a victim, a commentary on McLaren’s team ethic, and a research based essay on how parental fears translate onto children. Each article will uniquely demonstrate the author's interest toward a certain dilemma to inspire your own thinking.
