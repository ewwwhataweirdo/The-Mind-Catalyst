      Why the Mind Catalyst?

      On January 14, 2024, I stood alongside another teenage girl on a massive stage, facing coaches, peers, family members, and opponents. The two of us stood at the center, alone, silently hoping for the other's downfall. Neither of us knew who had won the final round. At any moment, one of us would be crowned the champion.

Then—surprise! My name wasn’t called.

I walked down, accepted my second-place plaque, and returned to the audience. Months of preparation, research, and case-building—only to lose? I had felt so passionately about what I argued. It didn’t matter whether I was on the affirmative or negative side of a round; I truly believed in my case. It stood for the people of the Middle East. It stood for justice. My stance on U.S. military presence in West Asia and North Africa wasn’t just an argument—it was a conviction.

As I made my way to my seat, my coach suddenly shouted:

"It's not true! They messed up the names! You are the champion!!" 


I was born in Florida, but I’ve lived everywhere. At eight years old, I moved to my home country, the Republic of Georgia, and fell in love with cross-cultural dynamics. I learned the language, studied, and developed the mindset that shapes me today. Living in a small and developing country taught me gratitude, resilience, and the power of community. Even now, I have my own little village of supporters cheering for me from thousands of miles away.

At twelve, I convinced my parents to move to Boston. I wanted the highest level of education, which I believed was only accessible in New England. With my sister already in college there, the transition was seamless. I studied in Boston for three years at two different schools—until my grandfather fell ill in April 2024. My family decided to return to Florida to be closer to him.

It was in Florida that I truly found my passion for debate. I met my mentor and coach, Mr. Bravim, who introduced me to philosophy, politics, and international relations—the same coach who stood by me during that tournament. Debate transformed me. I had never been a competitive athlete, never won medals or went to sports tournaments. But in debate? I excelled. I found something that fused passion with talent, and I never looked back.

Fast-forward two years, and I realized something bigger: teenagers have voices that deserve to be heard. Through debate, I saw firsthand how young people often have more informed and nuanced perspectives than many adults. Yet, our ideas are frequently overlooked. It was time to change that.

And so, I founded The Mind Catalyst—a platform where Generation Z can express their thoughts, challenge ideas, and engage in meaningful debate. My hope is that every post on this blog encourages you to think critically, question boldly, and educate yourself fearlessly.

Because, after all, we are the future.
